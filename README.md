# Fingerprint for moodle

This is just a quick grab through the moodle sourcecode and hash
generation to check against moodle pages to determine the versions.

All hashes are generated without spaces, so you need to remove them from
the source page before comparing it with sha256 hashing.

Not checked yet if there are some diffs to the official moodle release zip.
